Battle Quiz for Pokémon Go.

This app is intended for Pokémon Go players that wish to improve their knowledge in type advantage when battling.

Two Pokémon types are randomly chosen and the player has to decide what the outcome of the encounter is going to be. If the answer is correct, one point is granted to the player.

The algorithm for the attack rate is coded on the app (rate_util.dart), and it was based on available online resources (like https://pokemongo.gamepress.gg/pokemon-go-type-chart). Code was minified since it's very verbose, but the idea is there :)

A lot of evolutions and improvements come to mind, but I'll need a lot more than 5KB to do that!
